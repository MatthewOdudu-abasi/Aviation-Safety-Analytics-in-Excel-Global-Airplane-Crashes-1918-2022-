## Project Overview

This project is a **group-based analytical dashboard built using Microsoft Excel** to analyze global airplane crash data spanning from **1918 to 2022**. The objective is to uncover long-term trends in aviation accidents, identify the most common crash causes, analyze fatality and survivability patterns, and evaluate how crash outcomes vary by region, aircraft type, flight phase, and time.

Although this dataset was also analyzed using Power BI in a separate project, **this repository documents the Excel-based implementation**, showcasing strong spreadsheet analytics, dashboard design, and data storytelling skills using Excel alone.

## Objectives

- Analyze global airplane crash trends over time  
- Identify regions and countries with the highest crash impact  
- Examine fatality patterns by flight phase and crash cause  
- Evaluate aircraft models with high fatality and survivability rates  
- Demonstrate Excel’s capability for advanced analytics and dashboard design  

---

## Data Cleaning (Excel)

All preprocessing was done in Excel and included:

- Removal of duplicate and incomplete records  
- Standardization of country, region, aircraft, and flight phase names  
- Validation of numerical fields (fatalities, survivors, crash counts)  
- Categorization of crash causes (Human factor, Technical failure, Weather, etc.)  
- Extraction and validation of date components (year, month, day)  

---

## Key KPIs

- **Total Number of Crashes:** 28.53K  
- **Total Fatalities:** ~159K  
- **Number of Survivors:** 1.12K  
- **Most Common Crash Cause:** Human factor  

---

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Time Analysis:** Monthly fatality trends reveal seasonal and operational patterns  
- **Geographic Analysis:** North America records the highest fatality counts  
- **Flight Phase Analysis:** Cruise and landing phases account for the most fatalities  
- **Aircraft Analysis:** Legacy aircraft models show higher fatality exposure  
- **Survivability Analysis:** Significant variation exists by aircraft design

## Key Insights

- Human error is the dominant cause of aviation crashes globally  
- Older aircraft models are disproportionately involved in fatal incidents  
- Scheduled flights record the highest number of crashes due to traffic volume  
- Survivability varies significantly across aircraft types and crash conditions

## Importance of Excel in This Project

This project demonstrates that **Microsoft Excel can be used effectively for**:

- Complex data cleaning and transformation  
- KPI computation and reporting  
- Pivot table analysis  
- Advanced charting and dashboard layout design  
- Executive-level analytical storytelling  

The Excel dashboard stands as a complete analytical solution without reliance on BI automation tools.

## Recommendations

- Strengthen pilot training and human-factor mitigation programs  
- Improve weather forecasting and real-time communication systems  
- Accelerate fleet modernization and retire high-risk aircraft models  
- Enforce stricter regulatory oversight in high-crash regions  
- Standardize operating procedures and preventive maintenance practices  

---

## Conclusion

This Excel-based Global Airplane Crash Analysis highlights how historical aviation data can be transformed into meaningful safety insights using spreadsheet analytics alone. As a group project, it reflects collaborative analytical planning while also demonstrating individual proficiency in Excel dashboard design and data analysis. The project reinforces Excel’s relevance as a powerful analytics tool and supports data-driven approaches to improving global aviation safety.
